# nXplore
App that makes tourists familiar with Nepali culture (dress, food, festivals, dance and music).

    Primarily, we're only focusing on Food.
  
Due to language differences, tourists usually find it difficult to communicate with Nepalese. Our app tries to bridge the gap to help tourists get familiarized with the Nepalese society and its culture. This application gives tourists basic information regarding Nepali food,( clothing, festivities, cultural dances, music and artists.)
